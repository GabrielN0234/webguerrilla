                            In a parallel world, where the crisis
                            political-social has reached levels beyond
                            ours, governments have succumbed to the
                            power of large corporations.<br><br> The
                            democracy and diplomatic missions have
                            failed and now these corporations outsource
                            guerrillas to settle their differences.<br><br> The world
                            whole has become a battlefield in favor
                            of the interest of a few.<br><br>
                            WebGuerrilla is a strategy game in
                            line that, thanks to its architecture distributed in
                            Internet, can grow in a way not before
                            imagined. Its purpose is to defeat all
                            other companies and their guerrillas.
